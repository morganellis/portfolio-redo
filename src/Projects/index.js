              We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in
              detention for whatever it is we did wrong, but we think youâ€™re
              crazy for making us write an essay telling you who we think we
              are. You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms, in
              the most convenient definitions. But what we found out, is that
              each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket-case, a
              princess, and a criminal. Does that answer your question?
